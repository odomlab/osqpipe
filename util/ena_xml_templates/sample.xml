     tag-value pairs. An example tag could be "Isolation Source" and the value
     could be "Seawater". You can also use the UNITS element to include
     scientific units. E.g., TAG "Age" VALUE "5" UNITS "Years". Please refer
     to online documentation for further help with sample tag-value pairs.
     Please delete any unused attributes and add as many as required. -->
